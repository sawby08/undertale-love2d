<p>My third attempt at writing an UNDERTALE battle engine in LÃ–VE! I'm mostly writing this for personal use, but anyone can use this if they make their way through my garbage code.</p>

<p>This engine is still unfinished. Here's a progress checklist:</p>

- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] Acting
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Red soul movement
- [ ] Blue soul movement (UNFINISHED: Doesn't adapt properly to other framerates)
- [x] Fight (Goes immediately to player controller)
- [x] Mercy (You can't do anything right now)
- [x] Attack system (Both player and enemies)
